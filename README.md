# JavaScript Polyfills

A personal project to implement and test common JavaScript polyfills from scratch to better understand how they work under the hood.

## ✅ Completed Polyfills

| Method                    | Status |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| `Array.prototype.forEach` | ✅     |
| `Array.prototype.map`     | ✅     |
| `Array.prototype.filter`  | ✅     |
| `Array.prototype.find`    | ✅     |
| `Array.prototype.every`   | ✅     |
| `Array.prototype.some`    |        |

## 📦 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-polyfills.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
